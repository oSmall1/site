            <h1>CYCLING DATING - A DATE WITH ACTIVITY, BIKE AND POSITIVENESS</h1>
                        <h1>CYCLING DATING - A DATE WITH ACTIVITY, BIKE AND POSITIVENESS</h1>
            <p>
                Cycling trips, with a touch of extreme, endurance, and overcoming oneself. <br>
                Cycling dating was born in 2023. At that time, I was preparing for my longest race of 2023, 1200km solo self-sufficient around Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
                and so I came up with the idea that I could also show others a part of the extreme world and show what you are capable of with the right motivation, 
                good will, and an excellent team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In two years, we overcame obstacles with purpose and from the initial 16km uphill to an enviable 350km across Slovenia. 
                During this time, lifelong friendships have developed, lives have changed and added value has been gained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being active is the most beautiful thing in life. With a company that stands by your side, guides, and encourages you, this is a unique experience. 
                It's nice every time we get together, and I'm happy to say that we're going into 2025 with a schedule of challenges that will attract many and get the blood pumping.

            <h2>Year 2024</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard to describe what we've experienced together. I can't describe the emotions, views, hugs, smiles,.. with words and numbers. It's impossible. 
                There's definitely no place like us to laugh as much as we did. What a crazy friendship we've built, and what a mutual vibe we've created. Crazy! 
                The most beautiful thing, really!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>We shared beautiful paths and crazy challenges together:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Royal Stage around the Julian Alps (we hugged Triglav)</li>
                <li>The Slovenian Diagonal Hodoš-Piran</li>
                <li>To Lake Vrbsko</li>
                <li>We conquered 21 peaks (full list in original content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Together we did <b>1,708.85km & 26,475 altitude meters</b>. Life is really beautiful!
            </p>
            <h2>Year 2025</h2>
            <p>
                In 2025 we will enter the THIRD YEAR of Dating. These trips are really the best thing that has happened to me too because it is exactly what I wanted—to have a date with a bike and great company. 
                Numbers are the last thing we worry about, and our pace is really adjusted to the whole group. <b>TEAM SPIRIT ALL THE WAY.</b>
